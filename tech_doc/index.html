                            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages
                            interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There
                            are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you
                            to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime
                            collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web
                            browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
                            programmatic control over them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core
                            set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
                            JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
                            objects; for example:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser
                            and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an
                            application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                            clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                            JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to
                            communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                            This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And,
                            likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written
                            in the browser.

                            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                            JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                            checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                            control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                            JavaScript.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript
                            supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
                            Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
                            supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties
                            of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                            variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are
                            public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type
                            safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or
                            access private memory by corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based model means that
                            programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and
                            strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make
                            Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed
                            languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to
                            a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality,
                            and minimal requirements for object creation.

                            JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced
                            by Awk, Perl, and Python.

                            JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set.

                            The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:

                                // a one line comment

                            Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional
                            else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An if statement looks like this:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="javascript">
                            if (condition) {
                                statement_1;
                            } else {
                                statement_2;
                            }
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            Here, the condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. (See Boolean for
                            an explanation of what evaluates to true and false.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed. Otherwise, statement_2 is executed.
                            statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in
                            sequence, as follows:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="javascript">
                            if (condition_1) {
                                statement_1;
                            } else if (condition_2) {
                                statement_2;
                            } else if (condition_n) {
                                statement_n;
                            } else {
                                statement_last;
                            }
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            In the case of multiple conditions, only the first logical condition which evaluates to true
                            will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ …
                            }).
